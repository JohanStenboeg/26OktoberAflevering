# 26OktoberAflevering
Bunden forudsætning for programmering til d. 26 oktober.

A projekt with 4 classes working together featureing some classmates from my education.
A project showing some of the different things i've learned so far. 

What this program does:

This program contains 4 different classes. 
A students class, DatHoldet class, start class and MineMetoder class.
In the students class there are 4 different constructors that all require at least 1 argument.
The first constructer only requires a name.
The 2nd constructor requires a name and age. 
The 3rd constructor requires a name and eyecolor. 
The 4th constructor requires a name, age, gender, eyecolor and a height. 
There is 5 getter funktions, for getting name, age, gender, eyecolor and height. 
There is 4 setter funktions, for setting age, gender, eyecolor and height.
There is no setter for name, as its not possible to create an object without a name so it makes no point in creating a setter for that value. 
There is also a few getters and setters to either get the name of one of the students or set the height of a student.

In the DatHoldet class i've created 4 different objects or "students" using the 4 different constructors.

In the MineMetoder class i've created 5 different methods of getting different things.
- get a random number between 1 and 10. 
- add a usercomment using console imputs
- get 5 numbers from 1-5.
- a counter that counts from 1 to 15
- a method for getting current time. 

In the start class i have imported the
